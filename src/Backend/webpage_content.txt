League Rules
All teams are signed up to a full season which always consist of 20 weeks (2 x 10 week block bookings) (Full Season). Please confirm with your League Manager exact dates if required. However, any team wishing to leave the league prior to the end of the season must contact the relevant League Manager and every attempt will be made to find a replacement, but without guarantee.
Football Mundial operate a flexible squad system so an unlimited amount of players can be used to enable all teams field a team weekly and fulfil each league fixture.
You will pay us full match fee for cancelling a match or failing to attend a fixture. If a match is cancelled on less than 48 hours’ notice and we are unable to arrange your opponents another game you will also pay us the opponent’s match fee. As Team Organiser you agree to make full payment all fees charges and fines relating to your team. These are payable to us by debit card or bank transfer within 48 hours of the relevant fixture date.
If a team cancels then the opposing team must still turn up for a friendly if the game is provided by Football Mundial. The team will win 5-0 and pay for the match as normal.
Teams are automatically signed up to a new season, if any team does not wish to continue then a two week notice period must be given before the end of the current season by emailing the league manager with a request to leave 2 weeks prior to the end of the season (league managers details can be found above the league table on the website.
Teams are not allowed to leave the league with arrears. All debts must be cleared in full two weeks prior to the end of the season or a team will be automatically enrolled into the new season.
In the event of a major sports event or a one-off event that would prevent multiple teams from attending a fixture, in the best interest of the league and teams, Football Mundial may offer a reduced cancellation fee of £20, or, an alternative playing time on that day, to ensure pitch fees still are covered.
Any player receiving a red card will be fined £10 which is payable before playing again. Any serious discipline will be reported to the relevant County FA.
Deposit System
Deposits must be paid prior to the team’s first fixture
Teams will have their deposit returned as their final game with Football Mundial.  The following must be carried out for this to coincide:
Teams must not have money outstanding, outstanding fees will be taken from the deposit.
Teams must turn up for all matches with out none attendances or cancellations.  In order to continue after a cancellation or none attendance teams must pay their deposit again otherwise they could face removal and the deposit being used for our costs.
Teams must give 14 days written notice before the end of a season if they wish to leave, if not then the deposit will be rolled over into the new season and the team continues into said season.
